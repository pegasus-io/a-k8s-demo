# Atlantis image defintion

Using version `Atlantis` version `x.y.z` : `March 2020`

## Installing `Atlantis` in the base alpine image

* `Atlantis` can be installed on linux and MacOS, but not windows.
* I like bash, and installed it in my base alpine blend : `./install-atlantis.sh`


```bash

export GH_TOKEN=ea1beefea1beef42553Xf



```

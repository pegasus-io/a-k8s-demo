# Notes about AWS CLI

Those notes were originally written in march `2020`.

Those notes updates will be dated in the following table :

| Date         | Update regarding |
| ----------   | ---------------- |
| `20/03/2020` | Original Draft   |
| `---` | [....]   |

As mentioned [in the official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html), there are currently two major versions of the AWS CLI, both actively maintained, the most recent, version `2`, having new features not available in the previous major version, version `1` :

>
> `AWS CLI` version `2` is the most recent major version
> of the `AWS CLI` and supports all of the latest features.
> Some features introduced in version `2` are not backward
> compatible with version `1` and you must upgrade to
> access those features.
>

I will first provision the `AWS CLI` in its latest version, because I will use it against AWS Free Tier, which certainly will welcome the latest version of the CLI.
